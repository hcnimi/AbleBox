## Heading ##
AbleBox enables you to store your files in the cloud, so that you can access and share your files from anywhere in the world.

## Sub-Heading ##
For teams and individuals to focus on what matters.

## Summary ##
AbleBox is a SaaS that enables users to upload their files to the cloud, offering individuals and teams the ability to create and collaborate efficiently.

## Problem ##
1. Individually, files don't take up much hard drive space, but they add up and can slow down a system considerably.
2. Collaborative work often requires multiple individuals to have access to not just the same file, but the latest version of the same file. Having to maintain the latest revision of a file across a team can be cumbersome and lead to miscommunication.

## Solution ##
- Save hard drive space with cloud storage
- No need to send files to people individually/single source of truth
- Trusted backup
